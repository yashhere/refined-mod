<!--
     This is a helper file that adds previous and next links to the bottom of each
     blog post. (below next and previous refer to chronological next and previous)

     It will check to see if there is a previous blog post. If is, it will print
     an arrow as well as the title of the previous post as a link as
     left-justified text.

     It will then check for a next blog post. If there is one it prints the title
     of the next post with a right arrow as right justified text on the same line.

     If there is ever not a next or previous post, it does nothing.

     This is inside the 'container' class div block that began in default_head.html.
